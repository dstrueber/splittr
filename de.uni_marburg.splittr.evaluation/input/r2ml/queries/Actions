6. ACTIONS 

R2ML offers support both for production rules and reaction rules. With this respect it defines the concept of an action. An action  is either an InvokeActionExpression or an AssignActionExpression or a CreateActionExpression or a DeleteActionExpression. R2ML also provides message actions in the form of a concrete SOAPAction.
