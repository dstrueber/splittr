Menus are collections of many menu items, which in turn are affiliated with core or extension pages. Menu items can also serve as aliases for other menu items. The menuitmes are part of a tree structured hierarchy, i.e. except for the root item, each menu item has a menu item as parent. To display a menu on an application it must be assigned to a menu representation, which can be placed at an existing template position.
