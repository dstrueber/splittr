Content may take various forms. In addition to the basic content in form of articles, which contain content in form of text combined with different media content, other content types exist. One of such a content type are weblinks, which represent both internal and external links. Newsfeeds are a special form of content, which get used by rss readers. The content type banner gets used for a dynamic layout specification of the application. Another content type are contacts, which are associated to users and contain additional contact information. Each content type is assigned to a category of the respective content type. E.g. articles are assigned to article categories, whereas weblinks are linked to a weblink category and so on. To specify parameters for the content, each content has metadata options and options depending on the specific content type.
