The Deployments package specifies constructs that can be used to define the execution architecture of systems and the assignment of software artifacts to system elements. A streamlined model of deployment, sufficient for the majority of modern applications, is provided. Where more elaborate deployment models are required, the package can be extended through profiles or metamodels to represent specific hardware and/or software environments.
