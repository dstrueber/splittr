An Activity is a kind of Behavior that is specified as a graph of nodes interconnected by edges. A subset of the nodes are executable nodes that embody lower-level steps in the overall Activity. Object nodes hold data that is input to and output from executable nodes, and moves across object flow edges. Control nodes specify sequencing of executable nodes via control flow edges.  Activities are essentially what are commonly called “control and data flow” models. Such models of computation are inherently concurrent, as any sequencing of activity node execution is modeled explicitly by activity edges, and no ordering is mandated for any computation not explicitly sequenced.
