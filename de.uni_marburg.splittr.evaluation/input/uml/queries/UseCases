UseCases are a means to capture the requirements of a system, i.e., what a system is supposed to do. The key concepts specified in this clause are Actors, UseCases, and the subject. A UseCase’s subject represents the system or systems under consideration to which the UseCase applies. Users and any other systems that may interact with the subject are represented as Actors. The required behavior of the subject is specified by one or more UseCases, which are defined according to the needs of Actors.
