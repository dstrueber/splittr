Nurses are affiliated with a single ward, while physicians and technicians can be affiliated with several different wards. All personnel have access to a calendar detailing the hours that they need to be present at the various wards. Nurses record physicians' decisions. These are written on paper and handed to an administrative assistant to enter. The administrative assistant needs to figure out who needs to be at a particular procedure before they enter it in the system.
