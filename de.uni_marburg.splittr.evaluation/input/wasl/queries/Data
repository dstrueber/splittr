WASL Data is a semiformal modeling language for CIM modeling in the WASL MDSD stack and offers language elements for representing the structural domain aspects of a web application in the form of a data model.  
 
The metamodel of WASL Data resembles the UML metamodel for class diagrams and generally offers language elements for specifying packaged entity types, typed properties and associations between these properties. The central language element Entity represents an entity type of the conceptual domain. A type hierarchy can be built with the EReference generalization for defining the super type of an entity and with the EReference specializations for multiple opposite subtypes. An entity can possess properties, which are subdivided into ValueProperties and ReferenceProperties. The super type Property allows merging collections of both Property types in one single collection. This is important for specifying an ordered set of properties mixed of ReferenceProperties and ValueProperties, which for instance is represented in the resulting web application as an ordered list of input fields and select boxes contained in a HTML form.
