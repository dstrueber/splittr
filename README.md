Splitting models using information retrieval and model crawling techniques
-------


Splittr tackles the maintainability challenge induced by large models. It facilitates the splitting of a large Ecore meta-model into a set of smaller, more comprehensible sub-models. The tool automatically creates a splitting suggestion from a splitting description. The splitting description is a set of (usually sketchy) textual descriptions for each of the desired sub-models. The splitting suggestion is a set of mappings from input model elements to target sub-models. For post-processing, a visual editor allows to review the splitting suggestion and, where required, reassign model elements to different sub-models.
